# Canard-Analysis-Explains-EADs_PLoSCompBio2020

This repository contains AUTO (C and Python) scripts and some printouts for the analysis presented in the peer-reviewed scholarly PLoS Computational Biology journal article: "Canard analysis reveals why a large Ca2+ window current promotes early afterdepolarizations in cardiac myocytes"

AUTO is used to conduct a bifurcation analysis of both the full system (Archive_EAD_Luo) and of the desingularized reduced system (Archive_EAD_DesingLuo). It is also used to compute difficult-to-compute canard solutions which organize the number of EADs elicited (canards_sym).
